.SH BUGS
The only configuration is provided by editing the source code, which is
quite unpleasant. The downloaded pages are kept after the program exits,
not sure if this should be changed. Tell me your opinion about that!
.P
mkdict needs an installed skip(1) and fnuu(1). But at the moment no other unix tool
does what skip does. If you know one, tell me.
